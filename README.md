# Version Control System (VCS):

### Git is a VCS that tracks changes to files and directories over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project.
### It maintains a history of changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions, track who made specific changes, and resolve conflicts between different versions of the code.

# Distributed System:

### Git is a distributed version control system, meaning each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history, on their local machine.
### This decentralization allows developers to work offline, commit changes locally, and collaborate with others without relying on a central server.
